# ASM_SWEEPER

![screenshot](images/Screenshot.png)

Asm Sweeper was made in x86_64 Assembly using NASM for a Computer architecture and organization project from ICT-Unifesp.

I used some codes from https://github.com/NikitaIvanovV/snake-asm to make the terminal draw the map. The idea for the game mechanics came from https://cakethursday.itch.io/kelpie.
